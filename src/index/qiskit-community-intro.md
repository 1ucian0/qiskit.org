## Welcome to the community

Welcome to Qiskit's global community, where you can connect with other users and contributors. Take a look to our next Qiskit Camps, physical events where we invite our community of researchers, developers and students to create new concepts and ideas by using Qiskit.

Also here you will be able to apply to our Qiskit Advocates program.

See our [code of conduct](https://qiskit.org/es6-bundled/data/codeofconduct.pdf) to learn more.
